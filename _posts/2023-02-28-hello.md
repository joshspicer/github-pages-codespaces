Hi, thanks for viewing my theme! Feel free to edit it in any way you want, just be cool and leave the necessary credits somewhere visible. If you could star the repository, that'd be pretty cool as well.

Here's a list of things you should probably do after installing this theme:

* Edit `_config.yml` with your actual information. Classic Jekyll.
* Edit `about.md` with your actual information
* Go to `css/main.scss` and edit `brand-color` to any color you want to change the header color!
* Delete these filler posts and add some new ones!
